# React (0.14.3) example using es2015 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/code0wl/react-example-es2015.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ositoozy/react-example-es2015)

On the react site there is a demo on how to learn to think with react. This is the same tutorial executed using ES2015 and webpack as a build process. There are some gotcha's transforming your code to ES2015 whilst using React. In this demo there is a solution for these common challenges.

Follow the original and great tutorial here [Es5 thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) and check the syntax differences using this project.
